<h2 class="subhead">B.Tech (Computer Science and Engineering)</h2>
<p align="justify">The B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering is one of the most popular programmes at N.I.T.K Surathkal. The programme was stated in 1986 and has been designed to cater to global demands and offers a balanced coverage of hardware and software systems. The programme includes elective courses covering thrust areas such as Distributed Systems & Computing, Parallel Architectures & High performance computing, High-Speed Networks, Designing with Network Processors, Security and Embedded Systems Cloud Computing etc. The B.Tech. programme enjoys an enviable placement of almost 100% year after year. About 25 to 35% of the students pursue higher studies after their graduation, mostly in U.S with scholarship and even without fellowship. </p>

<p>Average Intake (per year) :110</p>
<p>Admission : Through JEE(Main) as per guidelines of MHRD</p>

<br>

<h2 class="subhead">M.Tech (Computer Science and Engineering)</h2>
<p align="justify">The M.Tech.(CSE) is a four semester course and was started in 1996. The course is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in various frontier areas of Computer Science and Engineering including Computer Architecture, Software Systems, Parallel and Distributed Computing and Networking with Web Technologies. To provide a sound basis, sufficient amount of theoretical input is also given to the students. Another feature of the programme is that the students will have ample opportunity to carry out research & software development in the labs. </p>

<p>Average Intake (per year) :27</p>
<p>Admission : Through GATE as per guidelines of MHRD</p>

<h2 class="subhead">M.Tech. (Computer Science and Engineering - Information Security)</h2>
<p align="justify">M.Tech(CSE-IS) is a four semester course aimed to focus on the recent developments in the areas of Information Security. The course was offered for the first time in 2007. The curriculum for these P.G programmes has been carefully crafted to cater the need of those students who are admitted with their basic degree in computing. In other words, care is taken, not to repeat the same, good old courses of U.G in the P.G level.</p>

<h2 class="subhead">Ph. D. (Doctor of Phylosophy)</h2>
<p align="justify">The department has a doctoral programme with an annual intake of 5-10 students per year. Admission to the doctoral programme is through a rigorous process of test and interview conducted by the department. The department now accomodated 54 research scholars working on diverse areas in computer science.</p>
