            To enrich technical aptitude and to develop application-oriented thiking, the curriculum of both B.Tech and DD programmes expect the students to spend their summer constructively in industry/academia/research labs. Our students have done exceptionally well in summer internships and many have received pre-placement offer from leading software corporates. A few of our students have received international internship offers as well.
